                     I have hands-on experience in designing and developing responsive websites using HTML and CSS, with skills that extend to creating intuitive, user-centered interfaces. Recently, I completed summer training where I deepened my understanding of front-end development by building projects like form validation systems. I am passionate about crafting seamless, 
                    accessible web experiences and constantly expanding my knowledge in programming and design to keep up with industry trends.</div>
